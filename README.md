Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Project

ðŸ“Œ_Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over time, and by building an effective predictive model, telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain customers.
